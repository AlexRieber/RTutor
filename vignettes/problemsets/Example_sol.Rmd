## Exercise 1 -- Summary statistics #####################################

a) We often want to compute some summary statistic of a vector.
For example:
```{r}
#< task
x = 10:20
# Computing the sum of x
sum(x)
#> task
```
Now compute the mean of x.
```{r}
mean(x)
#< hint
display("There already exist R functions for many things. To find them use Google, e.g. search for 'R compute mean'.")
#>
#<
give.award("mean means mean","Well, in some occasions one can just guess the name of an R function. The function to compute the mean of a vector, or matrix is called 'mean'. Usually, it is much quicker to goggle than to guess function names, however.")

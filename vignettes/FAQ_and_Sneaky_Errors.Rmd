# Sneaky errors that might occur when developing a problem set

- Problem: When running `create.ps` the following error message appears
  ```
  Error in nchar(paste0(code, collapse = "\n")) :
    invalid multibyte string, element 1
  ```
  + Answer: This is a nasty error that has to do with the *encoding* of your text file. Try the following with your _sol.Rmd file. In RStudio choose the menu `File -> Reopen with encoding`. Then pick the Encoding `UTF-8` and press ok. Now make some small changes in your file, save it and try again to run `create.ps`. Hopefully it now works...


- Problem: After changing the _sol.Rmd file and runing `create.ps` and `show.ps`, the browser opens but the changes do not appear in the shown problem set.
  + Answer: Make sure that you have correctly set the working directory with `setwd` to the folder in which your _sol.Rmd file is stored.

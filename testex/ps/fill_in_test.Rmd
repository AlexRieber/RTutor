# Problemset Fill In Example

```{r 'check_ps', include=FALSE}

user.name = 'test' # set to your user name

# To check your problem set, run the 
# RStudio Addin 'Check Problemset'

# Alternatively run the following lines
library(RTutor)
ps.dir = getwd() # directory of this file
ps.file = 'fill_in_test.Rmd' # name of this file
check.problem.set('fill_in_test', ps.dir, ps.file, user.name=user.name, reset=FALSE)
```


Note: Always save your solution files with UTF-8 Encoding!

Adapt the working directory below and run the setup chunk in RStudio. This creates the problem set files and the sample solution from this solution file.
